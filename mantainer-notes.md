# drake-lite-cmake's mantainer notes

This document is not meant for users of drake-lite-cmake, but as documentation
for steps that maintainers need to perform.

## Update drake version

If you want to update drake-lite-cmake to a new version of upstream CMake, you need to perform the following steps
on a platorm where bazel is installed: 
1. Change `DRAKE_UPSTREAM_VERSION` in `CMakeLists.txt` to the desired Drake version. If necessary, reset 
   `DRAKE_LITE_CMAKE_REVISION` to 0.
2. Configure the CMake project by enabling the DRAKE_LITE_CMAKE_GENERATE_SOURCE_FILES option, 
   that will re-generated during the CMake configuration the `autogenerated/source_files.cmake` file.
3. Try to compile and test drake on your system. If it works correctly, commit the changes to the files in the repo
   (including the changes to the `autogenerated/source_files.cmake` file) and open a Pull Request (PR). 
4. If the Continuous Integration checks pass in the PR, merge the PR and crate a new release of drake-lite-cmake.
